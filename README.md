# my blog like repo - it's like an experiment yeah?

This is where I want to write my kind of day by day or weekly progress in my project and just do some fairly random writing.
I feel like I _might_ have got somewhere with git hub and sshing into to it.
Here I am in my lovely tmux/vim/powerline config my nerd-space typing away in dvorak because I really am that much of a bellend.
Self deprecating one sure, I love this set up though and that's all that matters.

I might rename this blog '**beating capitalism**' at some point when I work out what I want to write here about it.
So let's see if I can get this all the way to github - pretty sure that'll take me a few trys....
